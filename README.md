# UniMic
A wrapper for Unity's Microphone class with a visualizer

# Intro  
Unity offers a Microphone class but not a higher level of abstraction that owuld make its implementation a lot simpler. There are assets in the Unity asset store which do this and more but here is a free solution.  

# How to  
Just open the Unity project in Unity5+ and try the demo scene. The code is self explainatory.  

# Soon  
Ready to use spectrum methods such as for standard octaves
